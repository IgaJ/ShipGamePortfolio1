- 2 to 4 players
- 55 cards: 4 x 6 = 24 boat cards, 20 gold coins, 8 pirates, 3 cannons
- aim: to be the first to piece together 6 boat pieces of your colour

Rules:
- a boat consists of 6 cards to collect
- all cards are shuffled and put at the stack
- a player draws a card from a stack and shows it
- a player must take at least one card and decide to continue or pass
- a player must construct a boat of a colour he first picked, except if another player is already constructing this colour
- may only construct one colour boat a time
- if a player manages to collect all 6 pieces before any other, wins a game
- if he picks a  B O A T  C A R D another colour, puts it aside and may sell it or pay with it for the pirate
- once a player has collected 3  G O L D  C O I N S, he can buy a boat piece of his colour from another player (1 piece per turn). After purchaising his turn ends.
- players must sell a piece of boat when asked
- if a player draws a  P I R A T E card, he must return back the pirate plus 3 other cards (gold coins, boat pieces, even their own boat).
If a player has less than 3 cards, must return what he has. His turn ends.
- if a player draws a  C A N N O N card, can put it to the side ready to use when needed. It can serve as a payment for the pirate instead of loosing 3 more valuable cards.
A player can continue picking cards.
- once the main stack is used, the returned cards are shuffled and from now on serve as a new stack to resume the game
